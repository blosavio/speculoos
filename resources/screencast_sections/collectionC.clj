   [:p "Speculoos predicates are Clojure functions. A function is a scalar. Therefore, a Speculoos predicate is a scalar."]

   [:p "A predicate, being a scalar, can replace any scalar datum in a heterogeneous, arbitrarily-nested data structure. Another way of thinking about that, is that a scalar contained in a heterogeneous, arbitrarily nested data structure can occupy the exact same path as a predicate in a specification that mimics the shape of that structure. Predicate `int?` is located at index 0, same as scalar 42. Predicate `string?` is located at path [1 0], same as scalar \"abc\". And predicate `ratio?` is located at path [1 1 0], exactly the same as scalar 22/7. The predicates and scalars can be straightforwardly paired. That's how Speculoos performs scalar validation."]

   [:p "There is no such symmetry between a predicate and a collection. A predicate and a collection can utterly not share paths in a completely general manner. The nested vector and the predicate `vector?` both share path [1]. But since a predicate can not contain anything, any element contained in the nested vector can not be addressed."]
   [:p "Someone might try to imagine a way to arrange the collection predicates within a structure so that the paths would align, but then the shape of the specification would no longer mimic the shape of the data. Speculoos values that mimicry. It's straightforward and intuitive to compose a specification."]
