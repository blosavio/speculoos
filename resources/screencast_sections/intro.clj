Because of this separation, the predicates are simpler, the mental concept is cleaner, and the validations are correctly compartmentalized: validating the properties of a string datum is a completely separate concern from whether that string exists in the data."]

Speculoos can seamlessly consume predicate-like things, such as regular expressions (to validate string properties) and sets (to validate membership in a set). If we stuff those into a scalar specification, validation works just as we'd expect. 42 is an integer, 'abc' satisfies a-something-C-or-D-or-E, and 7 is a member of this set."]
