           [:li "I find it conceptually simpler to specify collections independently from scalars."]

           [:li "The way Speculoos decomposes a heterogenous, arbitrarily-nested data structure makes it straightforward to write utility functions, especially with the starred functions. Many of the functions in " [:code "speculoos.utility"] " are just a few lines. " [:code "speculoos.core/all-paths"] " exposes this deconstructed version of both the data and the specification, so that you can write your own utilities."]]]

           [:li [:p "On the other hand, Speculoos was haphazardly written by a " [:a {:href "contact.html"} "person"] " who'll put milk in the pantry. My ideas may be absurd."]]
           
           [:li [:p "Cardinal sin of software development: I have written relatively few Clojure specs, and yet I wrote a data specification lib."]]

           [:li [:p "I paid no particular attention to performance, and have done exactly zero performace benchmarking. In fact, some of Speculoos' bottom-level functions laboriously and ineffiently step through collections. I deliberately wrote this way for clarity to my inexperienced brain, with complete disregard for good performance."]]

           [:li [:p "There seem to be a decent number of Clojure " [:a {:href "pros_cons.html#alts"} "projects"] " that do roughly the same validation tasks with a similar look. Many appear to be mature and/or stable. Why not use one of those? Why not simply use " [:code "clojure.spec.alpha"] "?"]]

           [:li [:p [:strong "Speculoos is in a very " [:em "pre-alpha"] "."] " For example, if a specification+data is invalid, should it fail fast by returning a fully-qualified invalid key, or for maximum resiliency, should it pass the data along and return the invalid result out-of-band? Or, how could Speculoos give the user that choice: an argument flag, or an entirely different function? Also, function instrumentation is ever so barely " [:em "not broken"] "."]]

           [:li [:p "Skating to where the puck " [:em "used to be"] ". Roughly speaking, Speculoos aims to replicate an acceptable subset of " [:code "spec.alpha"] " functionality, more specifically, what is contained in the " [:a {:href "https://clojure.org/guides/spec"} [:em "Spec Guide"]] ".

           [:li [:p "The un-feature that might sink the entire Speculoos project: Because Speculoos predicates are regular functions, there is no straightforward way to automatically deconstruct them to create a generator. "
                 [:code "spec.alpha"]
                 " dedicates much effort to automatically producing generators to test and exercise functions. I would not be surprised to learn that "

                 [:code "spec/or"]
                 " instead of bare predicates precisely to enable this capability. Speculoos on the other hand, can only generate test values when the predicate is transparent, like "
                 [:code "int?"]
                 ". The moment a predicate gets wrapped like this "
                 [:code "#(int? %)"]
                 ", Speculoos can only rely on a generator that you manually supply."]]

           [:li [:p "Speculoos struggles when a thing could be either a scalar or a collection. For example, suppose you want to specify a " [:code "defn"] "  S-expression with a symbol in the first positon, a symbol in the second positon, then zero or one doctrings, followed by an argument vector, etc. A Speculoos collection specification is general enough to describe that pattern, but it's not quite as clean as it would be with " [:code "spec.alpha"] " regex sequence spec."
